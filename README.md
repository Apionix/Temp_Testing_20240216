## Scenarios
This section contains scenario questions to ask potential candidates to observe their problem solving skills and way of thinking. Each scenario consists of detailed background information and poses the candidate a question that they should answer. The idea is not to focus on the answer, but to pay attention to the way the candidate navigated to the answer. Use tools such as diagrams or whiteboards to help the candidate express their way of thinking and encourage them to take you through their process/approach.

### System

### .NET

## Code questions
Code questions are designed to dive into the more technical knowledge of a candidate to test them for specific skills.
